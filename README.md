# Machine-Learning-Heart-Disease-Prediction
#### As a means of testing my understanding on machine learning and it's application, I decided to engage in the following:
The error was:
#### **Objectives:**
1. To build a machine Learning classification model to determine wheather an individual will get a heart disease or not based on features such as:
<ul>
    <li>Age</li>
    <li>Chest pain type</li>
    <li>Maximum Heart Rate (Max HR)</li>
    <li>Cholesterol, etc</li>
</ul>

2. Apply label encoding to categorical features ie. norminal and ordinal variables
3. Analyze the effects of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Scaling of samples, oulier removal etc on the efficiency of the model
4. Apply cross validation and grid search on "pycaret's", Auto Ml top three supervised classification models
5. Save the model on a pickle file for deployment
6. Build a machine learning app using Streamlit's API for Heart Disease Prediction on the server
